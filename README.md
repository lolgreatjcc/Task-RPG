# Task-RPG
Task RPG is an app mainly catered to overcome executive dysfunction, a symptom of ADHD. 
As you already know, many victims of ADHD suffer from forgetfulness and lack of focus. 
Therefore, we made a gamified task manager that helps victims complete tasks they may have 
difficulty starting or following through by providing a sense of satisfaction with completing tasks.

# How to install and run the application: 
1) Fork the repository  
2) Clone the repository onto your local drive
3) Use expo to run the app 

# Inspiration
Inability to focus on and complete tasks at hand.
# What it does
A gamified task manager to tackle executive dysfunction
# How we built it
Using Expo-CLI and React Native

# What's next for Task RPG
We hope to add more monsters and features if we have more time in the future.

Note: When demoing the expo-cli snack, please use the IOS version.
