# Task-RPG
Task RPG is an app mainly catered to overcome executive dysfunction, a symptom of ADHD. 
As you already know, many victims of ADHD suffer from forgetfulness and lack of focus. 
Therefore, we made a gamified task manager that helps victims complete tasks they may have 
difficulty starting or following through by providing a sense of satisfaction with completing tasks.

# How to install and run the application: 
1) Fork the repository  
2) Clone the repository onto your local drive
3) Use expo-cli to run the downloaded project 

Alternative (& Preffered) way of running the application:
